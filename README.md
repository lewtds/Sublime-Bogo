Sublime-Bogo
============

Vietnamese input method for Sublime Text 2 and 3 using the
[BoGo engine](https://github.com/BoGoEngine/bogo-python).

We don't support Will Bond's Package Control yet so you have to install this
plugin manually. Sorry for the inconvenience.

```bash
$ cd ~/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages/
$ git clone https://github.com/pirackr/Sublime-Bogo.git
```

Every once in a while, you can update it with the following commands:

```bash
$ cd ~/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages/Sublime-Bogo
$ git reset --hard
$ git pull origin master
```

By default, the shortcut to turn it on/off is **Alt + Z**.
